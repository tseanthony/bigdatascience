These are my submissions to the assignments for the NYU's Big Data Science course with Professor Anasse Bari.

Assignment 1: From a corpus of documents, we applied preprocessing steps (tokenization, removal of stop words, and using Stanford's coreNLP library to associate words with attributes such as their part of speech, named entity, and lemma form. From these attributes, I created n-grams from the tokenized words, converted the documents to vectors, extracted topics from the corpus of documents, and used my own implementation of k-means clustering to group documents.

Assignment 2: Used the methods described in the first assignment to find terms associated with positive and negative tweets. The data set used was a file containing 1.6 million tweets, which required performing the computations on an remote NYU high performance computer.

Assignment 3: Implementation of K-nearest neighbors to classify a set of new documents according to the topics derived in assignment 1.
