Homework 2



NOTE 1: PLEASE DO NOT MOVE FILES



NOTE 2: YOU WILL NEED TO UNCOMMENT CODE IN "APP" CLASS TO GENERATE PLOTS
- The plots that I generated are in a folder called "Scatter_Plots"
- I left the graph generating code commented because the logger takes up space on the terminal. I do not want my graded output to get lost. 



HOW TO EXECUTE FROM TERMINAL 

1) In your terminal, navigate to the main at4091 folder.

2) Then navigate to the BDS.HW1 directory.

	cd BDS.HW1/

In the BDS.HW1 directory, enter the command:

	mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package

Run the executable:

	java -cp target/BDS.HW1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar AT4091.BDS.HW1.App

Output files will be located in the "target" folder.
